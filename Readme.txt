Generally, order book looks like this (B - bid, S - spread, A - ask), size defines how many shares can be bought/sold at this price:


PRICE  SIZE  TYPE  COMMENT
100    0     A     size is zero, but it is still ask price, because it is higher than best ask
99     50    A 	   best ask (lowest non-zero ask price)
97     0     S
96     0     S
95     40    B     best bid (highest non-zero bid price)
